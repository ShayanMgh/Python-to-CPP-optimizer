# Python to C++ Optimizer

This project converts Python code to high-performance C++ code using an Ollama model. The application is built with Gradio to provide a simple web interface for code conversion and execution.

## Features

- **Code Conversion:** Uses an Ollama model to translate Python code into optimized C++.
- **Execution Helpers:** Run Python code and compile/execute the generated C++ code.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Gradio for an intuitive web interface.
- **Platform Specific:** Optimized for Apple M2 (for C++ code compilation).

## Installation and Usage
